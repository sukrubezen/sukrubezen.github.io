Blogging history of me starts with blogger. It was easy to manage, self hosted, perfect to start with.

Later, I wanted to control my data on my own so I bought a hosting and domain and setup my wordpress blog.
But wordpress was like constant updates, slow reactions and lots of unnecessary and not user friendly code base.
I mean come on I just wanted to write my blog why so serious wordpress ?

Later, I discovered Jekyll and sites using jekyll could be hosted on github because github pages itself uses Jekyll. 
Just think about pushing a new page into a repo on github automatically updating your site. How cool is that ?

Create the Jekyll site on your local machine, push it to a github repo, add CNAME record on your DNS record and 
whenever you add a new page to your repo you will be able to reach it through your site automatically. That simple.
